There is a large setup violation of -4.987 ns between XLXI_7/inst/DCLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and digital3_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#23 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.035 ns between XLXI_7/inst/DCLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and digital4_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
